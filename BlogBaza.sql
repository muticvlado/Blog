Mearsheimer\'s The Great Delusion: Liberal Dreams and International Realities and Stephen M. Walt\'s...','Robert Jervis\' Liberalism, the Blob, and American Foreign Policy: Evidence and Methodology is a thoughtful review of two books written by prominent international relations theorists, John J. Mearsheimer\'s The Great Delusion: Liberal Dreams and International Realities and Stephen M. Walt\'s, The Hell of Good Intentions: America\'s Foreign Policy Elite and the Decline of the U.S. Primacy.[1] Their argumentas recounted by Jervisis that American foreign policy since the end of the Cold War has been a failure and that the reasons stem from the American domestic political system. For Mearsheimer, a prevailing form of Liberalism is at fault; for Walt it is the consensus of the foreign policy establishment (the Blob)\r\n\r\nJervis focuses his critique primarily on methodology, noting that in order to prove that American foreign policy failed, we need to either go through the counterfactuals (i.e. how better results could have been achieved through an alternative policy) or comparisons of the outcomes when the policy was present versus when it was not. He further, argues that the actual historical record is more complicated than either Mearsheimer or Walt suggests, since the Blob has not always been as powerful as Walt suggests, nor has the United States been as committed to liberalism as Mearsheimer contends. Ultimately, Jervis concludes that Walt and Mearsheimer\'s arguments are not supported by adequate evidence\r\n\r\nOverall, Jervis\'s review essay is well-reasoned and well-evidenced, but perhaps, could to be sharpened. The Blob does not exist. Liberalism is not a coherent or consistent strategy. And American foreign policy is not a failure.\r\n\r\nThe Blob Does Not Exist\r\nWalt is not alone in believing that a Blob controls American foreign policy. As Jervis mentions, former Barack Obama Administration Deputy National Security Advisor Ben Rhodes popularized the term to deride other foreign policy experts, including some fellow Obama administration alumni like former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Secretary of Defense Robert Gates. Over the years, other administrations have expressed similar frustrations. For example, the Donald Trump administration jettisoned the term in favor of the even more nefarious sounding deep state, but retained the core concept: namely, that there is a faceless, unthinking but all-powerful collective pulling strings of government in order to block prudent policymaking. While these terms undoubtedly have powerful illustrative appeal, they are for several reasons better suited to dystopian fiction than to describing how Washington makes policy.','2021-03-03',0,0,'https://cdn.nextgov.com/media/img/upload/2020/05/04/shutterstock_398557120/route-fifty-lead-image.jpg','',1,NULL,'sanja'),(18,1,2,'Myanmar Coup: First Foreign Policy Test for President Biden','He first test of President Joe Biden\'s foreign policy came fast: Shortly after dawn on February 1, Myanmar\'s military staged a coup d\'état against the nation\'s fledgling civilian government.','he first test of President Joe Biden\'s foreign policy came fast: Shortly after dawn on February 1, Myanmar\'s military staged a coup d\'état against the nation\'s fledgling civilian government.\r\n\r\nThe army arrested Aung San Suu Kyi, along with most of the top officials in her party and many other citizens throughout the country. The U.S. response will be seen by many as an early indication of the new administration\'s priorities: How will it balance the competing demands of support for democracy and practice of realpolitik?\r\n\r\nThere are no easy solutions, and this first test will be widely seen as a template for other thorny situations in the future. In crafting a response to the coup in Myanmar, the administration would be well advised to take account of five basic truths.\r\n\r\n1. It\'s Not All About Us\r\nThis is not part of a grand contest between the West and China, nor an ideological struggle between democracy and authoritarianism. Myanmar\'s military, the Tatmadaw, acted for its own internal reasons, most of which are not related to geopolitics.\r\n\r\nTo the extent that external countries have influence in Myanmar, China is by far the most important player. The United States may not even be second: Japan, Thailand, South Korea, India, Singapore, and several European nations all have more significant economic, military, and diplomatic engagement.\r\n\r\n2. It\'s Partly About Us\r\nThe symbolism of the United States resonates in Myanmar, as it does across the world. After the Tatmadaw\'s affiliated political party lost a key election in November, it spent two months floating baseless charges of election fraud as preemptive justification for its coup. Sound familiar?\r\n\r\nThis isn\'t the first time that language of U.S. leaders may have been appropriated by political figures in Myanmar to disastrous ends. Since 2017, about 740,000 Rohingyas have been forcibly displaced following several years of harsh anti-Muslim rhetoric on Facebook and elsewhere in Myanmar (including spurious linkages to al Qaeda) that precisely echoed the words of some American policymakers in the post-9/11 period.\r\n\r\n3. Democracy Requires Protection of Vulnerable Minorities\r\nAung San Suu Kyi\'s party, the National League of Democracy (NLD), won 80 percent of the seats in Myanmar\'s 2015 election, and 83 percent in the November 2020 contest.\r\n\r\nIt has overwhelming support among the ethnic Bamar majoritybut the NLD never truly represented the ethnic and religious minorities who make up one-third of Myanmar\'s 51 million citizens.\r\n\r\nAung San Suu Kyi went from being an international heroine, and recipient of the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize, to global pariah after staunchly supporting the violent repression of the Rohingyas. Whatever solution the world community tries to advance for Myanmar, it should be predicated on support for democracy writ large, rather than personalized in support for Suu Kyi.\r\n\r\n4. Go to Bed with Dictators, and You\'ll Wake Up on the Floor\r\nSidestepping international criticism for not labeling Myanmar\'s mistreatment of the Rohingya as genocide, Suu Kyi tried to assuage the Tatmadaw by using her Nobel credibility to present their case before the International Court of Justice at the Hague.\r\n\r\nThe United States and other nations also tried to court Myanmar\'s junta by precipitously dropping economic sanctions in 2016. The Tatmadaw pocketed the concessions, and then did as it pleased. It will very likely do the same next time.\r\n\r\n5. The Outside World Has Few Tools to Usebut It Should Use What It Has\r\nSanctions are unlikely to force a reversal of the coup, but that doesn\'t mean they\'ll have no impact. After its prior coup in 1990, the military endured sanctions for two decades before releasing Suu Kyi from house arrest and agreeing to hold elections.\r\n\r\nContrary to some Western analysis, the Tatmadaw remains highly suspicious of China and is eager to break free of dominance by its overweening neighbor.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the opening up of Myanmar since 2011 has unleashed popular engagement with the outside world that will be difficult for the Tatmadaw to control: The streets of Yangon and most other cities changed relatively little between the nation\'s independence (1947), its first coup (1962), and the start of the current democratic experiment a decade ago. But those same streets look very different today. If the Tatmadaw wants to maintain military rule, it will have to resort to increasingly severe levels of repression: It won\'t be able to count on a populace that has never known anything different.\r\n\r\nSanctions are unlikely to force a reversal of the coup, but that doesn\'t mean they\'ll have no impact.\r\n\r\nShare on Twitter\r\nBeyond Myanmar, sanctions send a message to the rest of the world: Violations of global norms will have consequences. Under the Trump administration, the United States used its economic leverage to advance intentionally narrow self-interested aims. Application of carefully targeted sanctions in response to the coup in Myanmar could represent a break from that use of American power.\r\n\r\nThe Tatmadaw has presented the world with a fait accompli, and gambled that no nation will do much more than issue an expression of concern. How President Biden responds will be watched closely, by friend and foe alike.\r\n\r\nThere is no quick path to policy success. But a tough-minded approach in support of democracy and human rightsan approach forged and carried out by a truly global coalition acting in concertcould lay down an important marker. Such a firm, multilateral approach might have the greatest chance of achieving progress in Myanmar itself, and may help deter others from thinking that such blatant violations of universal standards are cost-free.\r\n\r\nJonah Blank is a senior political scientist specializing in Asia policy at the nonprofit, nonpartisan RAND Corporation.

Democracy held, but security failed, spectacularly.\r\n\r\nWe need to be better prepared for future acts of political violence. This will not end on Inauguration Day.\r\n\r\nAlthough there are disturbing reports and photos of an officer taking a selfie with members of the crowd, or standing by while inadequate security barriers were breached, the Capitol Police were clearly outnumbered. No reinforcements arrived until long after the mob poured into the building. Security and the response appeared improvised.\r\n\r\nIt could have been a massacre. For weeks, anonymous internet users have talked about smuggling guns into the District of Columbia, an observation that had been publicized in the news media. When the security barriers were breached, no one knew whether some of the attackers were carrying concealed weapons. Had even a few been armed and determined to kill, it would have turned the congressional chambers into a killing field. Instead of trashing offices, the intruders could have taken elected officials hostage; it was only in October that the FBI thwarted a plot by right-wing extremists to hold the governor of Michigan hostage.\r\n\r\nWe need to be better prepared for future acts of political violence. This will not end on Inauguration Day.\r\n\r\nShare on Twitter\r\nThe failure of planning is incomprehensible. It is not just that Washington has been seized by massive protests all year. The Capitol has been a target many times in the past. In 1954, Puerto Rican separatists opened fire from the gallery of the House of Representatives, wounding five members of Congress. There have been several bombings. In 1998, an armed individual broke through security at the Capitol and two Capitol police were killed. The Capitol Building was the probable fourth target of the 9/11 hijackers whose plane crashed in Pennsylvania and a terrorist attack on the building has been a worry ever since.\r\n\r\nFormalizing the constitutionally mandated electoral count was identified as the last opportunity to change the outcome of the November election. Groups with histories of violence were openly gathering in the nation\'s capital. No one thought the Capitol Building might be a target?\r\n\r\nThere was a thin security perimeter outside the building, but apparently no pre-established security perimeters inside, apart from a few officers. No hallways were blocked. Once inside, intruders wandered the building freely. A credenza was pushed in front of the doors into the congressional chamber while members hid behind desks.\r\n\r\nThe Capitol Police has 2,300 officers and an annual budget of $460 million. There are other federal agencies in Washington that can provide additional resources. The fact that both the FBI and the Secret Service called on their personnel to assist is more evidence of an improvised response.\r\n\r\nJanuary 6 is now a day to be remembered on the calendar of violent resistance to the federal government. Emerging from Wednesday\'s debacle are diehards whose fantasies of a stolen election are still being fueled. They could now be emboldened by their successful confrontation: They won the battle of Capitol Hill. A continuing deep sense of injury coupled with an unrealistic assessment of their own power is always a bad combination.\r\n\r\nDefiance is not easily put back in the box. Wednesday\'s events may cause some previously inflammatory political leaders to sober up, but to the self-appointed patriots striding triumphantly through the Capitol hallways, any weak denunciations by such politicians may only feed their sense of betrayal and harden their resolve.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have entered a new era. The nation could see massive demonstrations to show continued political opposition to President-elect Biden. January 20 could see a counter-inauguration. February\'s State of the Union address could also entice extremists to take action when the nation is watching.\r\n\r\nBut I worry less about mobs in Washington than I do about terrorist plots by diehards after the inauguration. Death threats have become common against health officials and political leaders during the coronavirus pandemic. A plot to kidnap a governor has been revealed and foiled. It is not difficult to imagine death threats, attempted assassinations of political leaders, and other acts of terrorism.\r\n\r\nThe 2020s could turn out to be a turbulent decade.\r\n\r\nBrian Michael Jenkins is a senior adviser to the president of nonpartisan, nonprofit RAND Corporation, and directs the National Transportation Security Center at the Mineta Transportation Institute.

You can do a lot better by avoiding these mistakes while learning Java.','To code or not to code? It seems that youve made your choice in favor of the first option. Programming is a great field for professional growth, It gives you an opportunity to take part in interesting projects and work wherever you want.\r\nThe only obstacle that restrains many beginners from starting a new career is the lack of understanding of how exactly should they learn to code. Whats more important is that even the best universities cant fully provide the education, which will guarantee a stark career as a software developer. The thing is that programming is too dynamic and flexible: once you start learning, you better do it for the rest of your life.\r\nSome programmers say, that theyve been trying to learn how to code a few times before finally reaching their goal. Yes, we all learn through mistakes, but youll be surprised how many common lapses are there in mastering this skill.\r\nTroubleshooting your learning experience\r\nIf youre determined to learn Java programming, here are few useful thoughts for you. Lets talk about mistakes, which almost all beginners do.\r\nToo many research, too little practice\r\nHeres what happens when you try to learn to code the ordinary way. All of us are used to study by reading books: the thicker the book, the more knowledge you will get, right? Sorry, this is not the case for programming.\r\nA lack of practice in coding is fatal. Just start coding. Start from the first day of your study and practice every single day. You wont learn to box or dance by watching videos. And you wont get confident in coding unless you make it your daily habit.\r\n2. Endless studying without a certain goal\r\nSome students, despite their age, simply love to learn. Its the process, not the result they aim for.

The first version of your app can only handle transportation by trucks, so the bulk of your code lives inside the Truck class.\r\n\r\nAfter a while, your app becomes pretty popular. Each day you receive dozens of requests from sea transportation companies to incorporate sea logistics into the app.\r\nAdding a new transportation class to the program causes an issue\r\n\r\nAdding a new class to the program isnt that simple if the rest of the code is already coupled to existing classes.\r\n\r\nGreat news, right? But how about the code? At present, most of your code is coupled to the Truck class. Adding Ships into the app would require making changes to the entire codebase. Moreover, if later you decide to add another type of transportation to the app, you will probably need to make all of these changes again.\r\n\r\nAs a result, you will end up with pretty nasty code, riddled with conditionals that switch the apps behavior depending on the class of transportation objects.\r\nSolution\r\n\r\nThe Factory Method pattern suggests that you replace direct object construction calls (using the new operator) with calls to a special factory method. Dont worry: the objects are still created via the new operator, but its being called from within the factory method. Objects returned by a factory method are often referred to as products.\r\nThe structure of creator classes\r\n\r\nSubclasses can alter the class of objects being returned by the factory method.\r\n\r\nAt first glance, this change may look pointless: we just moved the constructor call from one part of the program to another. However, consider this: now you can override the factory method in a subclass and change the class of products being created by the method.\r\n\r\nTheres a slight limitation though: subclasses may return different types of products only if these products have a common base class or interface. Also, the factory method in the base class should have its return type declared as this interface.\r\nThe structure of the products hierarchy\r\n\r\nAll products must follow the same interface.\r\n\r\nFor example, both Truck and Ship classes should implement the Transport interface, which declares a method called deliver. Each class implements this method differently: trucks deliver cargo by land, ships deliver cargo by sea. The factory method in the RoadLogistics class returns truck objects, whereas the factory method in the SeaLogistics class returns ships.\r\nThe structure of the code after applying the factory method pattern\r\n\r\nAs long as all product classes implement a common interface, you can pass their objects to the client code without breaking it.\r\n\r\nThe code that uses the factory method (often called the client code) doesnt see a difference between the actual products returned by various subclasses. The client treats all the products as abstract Transport. The client knows that all transport objects are supposed to have the deliver method, but exactly how it works isnt important to the client.\r\nStructure\r\nThe structure of the Factory Method pattern\r\n\r\n    The Product declares the interface, which is common to all objects that can be produced by the creator and its subclasses.\r\n\r\n    Concrete Products are different implementations of the product interface.\r\n\r\n    The Creator class declares the factory method that returns new product objects. Its important that the return type of this method matches the product interface.\r\n\r\n    You can declare the factory method as abstract to force all subclasses to implement their own versions of the method. As an alternative, the base factory method can return some default product type.\r\n\r\n    Note, despite its name, product creation is not the primary responsibility of the creator. Usually, the creator class already has some core business logic related to products. The factory method helps to decouple this logic from the concrete product classes. Here is an analogy: a large software development company can have a training department for programmers. However, the primary function of the company as a whole is still writing code, not producing programmers.\r\n\r\n    Concrete Creators override the base factory method so it returns a different type of product.\r\n\r\n    Note that the factory method doesnt have to create new instances all the time. It can also return existing objects from a cache, an object pool, or another source.\r\n\r\nPseudocode\r\n\r\nThis example illustrates how the Factory Method can be used for creating cross-platform UI elements without coupling the client code to concrete UI classes.\r\nThe structure of the Factory Method pattern example\r\n\r\nThe cross-platform dialog example.\r\n\r\nThe base dialog class uses different UI elements to render its window. Under various operating systems, these elements may look a little bit different, but they should still behave consistently. A button in Windows is still a button in Linux.\r\n\r\nWhen the factory method comes into play, you dont need to rewrite the logic of the dialog for each operating system. If we declare a factory method that produces buttons inside the base dialog class, we can later create a dialog subclass that returns Windows-styled buttons from the factory method. The subclass then inherits most of the dialogs code from the base class, but, thanks to the factory method, can render Windows-looking buttons on the screen.\r\n\r\nFor this pattern to work, the base dialog class must work with abstract buttons: a base class or an interface that all concrete buttons follow. This way the dialogs code remains functional, whichever type of buttons it works with.\r\n\r\nOf course, you can apply this approach to other UI elements as well. However, with each new factory method you add to the dialog, you get closer to the Abstract Factory pattern. Fear not, well talk about this pattern later.\r\n\r\n// The creator class declares the factory method that must\r\n// return an object of a product class.

Publish interface in an inheritance hierarchy, and bury implementation in its own inheritance hierarchy. Beyond encapsulation, to insulation.','Problem\r\n\r\n\"Hardening of the software arteries\" has occurred by using subclassing of an abstract base class to provide alternative implementations. This locks in compile-time binding between interface and implementation. The abstraction and implementation cannot be independently extended or composed.\r\nMotivation\r\n\r\nConsider the domain of \"thread scheduling\".\r\n\r\nBridge scheme\r\n\r\nThere are two types of thread schedulers, and two types of operating systems or \"platforms\". Given this approach to specialization, we have to define a class for each permutation of these two dimensions. If we add a new platform (say ... Java\'s Virtual Machine), what would our hierarchy look like?\r\n\r\nBridge scheme\r\n\r\nWhat if we had three kinds of thread schedulers, and four kinds of platforms? What if we had five kinds of thread schedulers, and ten kinds of platforms? The number of classes we would have to define is the product of the number of scheduling schemes and the number of platforms.\r\n\r\nThe Bridge design pattern proposes refactoring this exponentially explosive inheritance hierarchy into two orthogonal hierarchies  one for platform-independent abstractions, and the other for platform-dependent implementations.\r\n\r\nBridge scheme\r\nDiscussion\r\n\r\nDecompose the component\'s interface and implementation into orthogonal class hierarchies. The interface class contains a pointer to the abstract implementation class. This pointer is initialized with an instance of a concrete implementation class, but all subsequent interaction from the interface class to the implementation class is limited to the abstraction maintained in the implementation base class. The client interacts with the interface class, and it in turn \"delegates\" all requests to the implementation class.\r\n\r\nThe interface object is the \"handle\" known and used by the client; while the implementation object, or \"body\", is safely encapsulated to ensure that it may continue to evolve, or be entirely replaced (or shared at run-time.\r\n\r\nUse the Bridge pattern when:\r\n\r\n    you want run-time binding of the implementation,\r\n    you have a proliferation of classes resulting from a coupled interface and numerous implementations,\r\n    you want to share an implementation among multiple objects,\r\n    you need to map orthogonal class hierarchies.\r\n\r\nConsequences include:\r\n\r\n    decoupling the object\'s interface,\r\n    improved extensibility (you can extend (i.e. subclass) the abstraction and implementation hierarchies independently),\r\n    hiding details from clients.\r\n\r\nBridge is a synonym for the \"handle/body\" idiom. This is a design mechanism that encapsulates an implementation class inside of an interface class. The former is the body, and the latter is the handle. The handle is viewed by the user as the actual class, but the work is done in the body. \"The handle/body class idiom may be used to decompose a complex abstraction into smaller, more manageable classes. The idiom may reflect the sharing of a single resource by multiple classes that control access to it (e.g. reference counting).\"\r\nStructure\r\n\r\nThe Client doesn\'t want to deal with platform-dependent details. The Bridge pattern encapsulates this complexity behind an abstraction \"wrapper\".\r\n\r\nBridge emphasizes identifying and decoupling \"interface\" abstraction from \"implementation\" abstraction.\r\n\r\nBridge scheme\r\nExample\r\n\r\nThe Bridge pattern decouples an abstraction from its implementation, so that the two can vary independently. A household switch controlling lights, ceiling fans, etc. is an example of the Bridge. The purpose of the switch is to turn a device on or off. The actual switch can be implemented as a pull chain, simple two position switch, or a variety of dimmer switches.\r\n\r\nBridge example\r\nCheck list\r\n\r\n    Decide if two orthogonal dimensions exist in the domain. These independent concepts could be: abstraction/platform, or domain/infrastructure, or front-end/back-end, or interface/implementation.\r\n    Design the separation of concerns: what does the client want, and what do the platforms provide.\r\n    Design a platform-oriented interface that is minimal, necessary, and sufficient. Its goal is to decouple the abstraction from the platform.\r\n    Define a derived class of that interface for each platform.\r\n    Create the abstraction base class that \"has a\" platform object and delegates the platform-oriented functionality to it.\r\n    Define specializations of the abstraction class if desired.\r\n','2021-03-16',1,25,'https://sourcemaking.com/files/v2/content/patterns/Bridge_example.png',NULL,1,NULL,'vaso'),(24,1,20,'The solitude of queer safe havens in Sanctuary at Da Vinci Art Alliance','Logan Cryer pens an insightful reflection and description of \"Sanctuary: An Exploration of Queer Safe Havens,\" a group exhibition at Da Vinci Art Alliance.

Heres how to overcome it. ','As someone who has struggled with mental health in the past, Id rate my overall resilience through the pandemic at a C+. Not great, but still a passing grade. A few weeks ago, however, I found myself at somewhat of a low point, and in that state, something strange happened to me, something I had never experienced before.\r\n\r\nIt was a particularly cold week in mid-February. The confirmed COVID-19 case numbers in my area had remained at peak levels for months, and while vaccinations had begun it felt like things would get worse before they got better. Work was piling up, but I struggled to find the motivation to tackle it.\r\n\r\nMy fiancée and I needed to work on the fourth or fifth iteration of our wedding plans, but I hardly had the time or energy to dedicate to it. At the same time, it felt like I was losing touch with friends and family, but couldnt stand the idea of another conversation with my computer screen.\r\n\r\nAt the end of a difficult day, my fiancée asked if I wanted to watch a movie, and I completely froze. My brain felt like it was spinning out of control in response to a very basic question.\r\n\r\nI began calculating how long the movie would take, whether I would enjoy it, what else I needed or wanted to do that night, whether there was a sports game I wanted to watch, a friend I was supposed to catch up with, a wedding-related decision that had to be deliberated. While all of this was happening in my head, I could only offer my fiancée a blank stare that lasted an uncomfortably long time. Eventually my head started to pound, and I felt the weight of this choice the similar to past experiences with truly significant and life-changing decisions, like where to go to school or whether to accept a job offer.\r\n\r\nAs it turns out, a lot of people have experience similar states of decision paralysis over minor and relatively inconsequential decisions this past year.\r\n\r\nMy anecdotal sense is that its very common, and last March or April I had a very similar experience, says Daphna Shohamy, a neuroscientist at Columbia Universitys Department of Psychology and Zuckerman Mind Brain Behavior Institute. Shohamy recounted that experience in a CNN op-ed last April, describing how she similarly froze up when deciding what to make for dinner. It shouldnt have been a hard decisionit didnt feel like a particularly consequential onebut every decision felt fateful and overwhelming and taxing, she says.\r\n\r\nShohamy emphasizes that decision-making is already an enigmatic process, and while psychologists and neurologists understand some of the ways we make everyday choices, much of that process remains a mystery.\r\n\r\n    In an uncertain environment, every decision requires additional cognitive resources, and over time, those resources can get depleted.\r\n\r\nIt feels simple, deciding between what to eat or what movie to watch or what to do, but its not obvious or trivial how our brains come up with those answers, she says. When were in situations of great uncertainty, its suddenly very clear to us how much of a gamble each of our decisions are, and thats rattling.\r\n\r\nShohamy explains that in an uncertain environment, every decision requires additional cognitive resources, and over time, those resources can get depleted to the point where even mundane choices feel complex.\r\n\r\n[The pandemic] brings uncertainty to levels that were not used to, she says. I would argue were exposed to those levels of uncertainty all the time, because our world is uncertain, but now its obvious, we feel it in ways we dont normally feel it.\r\n\r\nWhat researchers can say about our decision making process with some degree of certainty is that it can be negatively impacted by stress, especially when sustained over prolonged periods.\r\n\r\nStress decreases our working memory capacity, so we have fewer cognitive resources to wrap our heads around all the different options, even for things that are relatively inconsequential, explains Art Markman, a professor of psychology and marketing at the University of Texas at Austin, and regular Fast Company contributor. Even minor decisions take a certain amount of cognitive effort, and theres a limited amount of that weve got in a day before were sort of done.\r\nOvercoming decision paralysis\r\n\r\nMarkman recommends a number of strategies for overcoming decision paralysis, even in difficult or stressful circumstances. The first is acknowledging that most decisions are not set in stone, and that choosing is only the first of many steps toward achieving a particular outcome.\r\n\r\nWe blow the decision up into being a much more significant part of the outcome than it really is, because a lot of what allows us to succeed at almost everything we do is how we follow up from the decision, rather than the decision itself, he says. If you take the perspective that everything is really a process, then it actually removes a lot of the stress around decision-making.\r\n\r\nMarkman adds that establishing predictable routines can help reduce the cognitive load of mundane decisions, and leave more mental resources for more important choices. That predictability creates a sense of comfort, and we find theres a sense of discomfort and even anxiety when things are unpredictable, he says.\r\n\r\nIts also important to recognize our own unique stress responses so that we can identify early warning signals and work through them before they spiral out of control, says author and leadership consultant Diana Hendel.\r\n\r\nSome people go silent, some people get edgy or irritable, some people avoid or withdraw, so understanding our individual stress response allows us to recognize when its happening so it doesnt overtake us, she says.\r\n\r\nHendel recommends conducting regular check-ins to evaluate signs of stress, and taking certain actions when they appear. She says one of the most effective ways to avoid retreating into our own anxieties is to take a moment to acknowledge the reality of the moment.\r\n\r\nIts about increasing that awareness of your surroundings, she says. Some people will identify 20 items in their view and say them out loud, or stretch their neck and relax their shoulders, even stomp their feet.\r\n\r\nHendel says we also inadvertently hold our breath when were stressed, adding that a simple breathing exerciselike box breathingcan reduce stress and ease the cognitive burden of decision making.\r\n\r\nI didnt engage in any of these activities when I was paralyzed by a simple decision a few weeks ago, but was still able to work my way through it. I promised my fiancée wed watch the movie the next day, and instead took the evening to relax and watch sports on my own. In the days that followed case numbers started dropping, the temperature began rising, work felt more manageable, and our wedding plans finally started coming together. I didnt understand the decision paralysis that I had experienced until I began researching this article, but I also didnt dwell on it too much either, which Markman says is key.\r\n\r\nIf you do find yourself experiencing some decision paralysis, dont beat yourself about it, he says. You can turn this from a momentary difficulty to something that carries a lot more import by worrying about it, like whats wrong with me? The answer is nothing. Just be kind to yourself, and dont worry about it too much.\r\nAbout the author\r\n\r\nJared Lindzon is a freelance journalist and public speaker born, raised and based in Toronto, Canada.

Many keen observers thought that the new Biden administration might reflexively adopt an anti-Trump stance, and urgently adopt cooperation with China on global challenges, such as climate change.\r\n\r\nThe prospects of a reset are rapidly fading, however, and both sides bear some measure of responsibility. On day one, the new Biden administration invited Taiwan\'s de facto ambassador, Hsiao Bi-khim, to participate in the inauguration ceremony. This was the first time China\'s rival received such an invitation since the United States switched its diplomatic recognition of Taiwan for China in 1979.\r\n\r\nIn an extreme overreaction, China flew dozens of warplanes, including eight bombers simultaneously, into Taiwan\'s air defense identification zone. Sensing that China was testing its red lines, the Biden team warned Beijing that its behavior \"threatens regional peace and stability\" and that Washington\'s commitment to Taiwan was \"rock-solid.\" Nevertheless, Chinese air incursions continued, prompting the United States to send a guided-missile destroyer through the Taiwan Straitthe first of three warship transits thus far under Biden.\r\n\r\nPresident Biden then called China \"our most serious competitor\" in his major foreign policy address on Feb. 4. He added that while the United States planned to \"confront\" China on a range of challenges, it was also \"ready to work with Beijing when it is in America\'s interest to do so,\" hardly a ringing endorsement for a wholesale reset.\r\n\r\nBiden also authorized the first Freedom of Navigation operation against China\'s disputed claims in the South China Seatwo more followedwith Secretary of State Antony Blinken holding a testy phone call with senior Chinese diplomat Yang Jiechi over not just China\'s assertiveness against Taiwan, but also its heavy-handed treatment of people within its territories of Xinjiang, Hong Kong, and Tibet. Blinken further criticized Beijing\'s \"undermining of the rules-based international order.\"\r\n\r\nBiden followed up with an interview with CBS\'s Face the Nation aired on Feb. 7, stating that the United States \"need not have a conflict but there is going to be extreme competition\" with China.

Fernando Alonso, Sebastian Vettel, Carlos Sainz, Daniel Ricciardo and Sergio Perez share 1075 grand prix starts between them and have enjoyed enormous success in F1, yet so far this season all have spoken of the need for more mileage before they are completely comfortable in their new surroundings having all joined new teams this year.','While it has always taken a little time for drivers to settle into new teams, the fact that so many outstanding drivers arent yet properly integrated demonstrates that its more difficult than it once was to do so. In the process, it reveals much about the modern grand prix car.\r\n\r\nBut there are also circumstantial factors. Pre-season testing was cut down to just three days as part of the reaction to the COVID-19 pandemic hitting, giving the newcomers a day-and-a-half  plus whatever limited running they can get during the two 100km promotional days teams have available  to become accustomed to their new cars.\r\n\r\nThat meant just a day-and-a-half of running during serious testing. Alonso notched up the most mileage, completing 206 laps in Bahrain pre-season, whereas mechanical problems that struck on both days Sebastian Vettel was in the car restricted him to just 117 laps.\r\n\r\nOn top of that, some have had old-car running. While Vettel and Ricciardo didnt have this benefit thanks to their teams not having machinery ready to run under the rules permitting what is called Testing of Previous Cars. This is defined as the running of cars designed and built for F1 in any of the three calendar years falling immediately prior to the calendar year preceding the championship.\r\n\r\nAlonso, Perez and Sainz have all benefited from this, and Sainz has continued to do so even after the start of the season with regular outings in the 2018 Ferrari SF71H at Fiorano. By regulation, these cars must run in period specification, meaning that their primary value is for driver training.\r\n\r\nTraditionally, becoming familiar with a new team was about learning the handling characteristics of the car and how to gel with the personnel, but theres more to it in modern F1. Mastery of the baffling array of tools available to the drivers, including the differential maps, brake shapes and engine settings (within the rules allowing only one map) is essential to extracting those final fractions in terms of lap time. As a result, F1 cars have arguably become more esoteric in recent times.\r\n\r\nWhats more, those tools can have a huge impact on the cars performance on turn-in, which is the key moment when F1 cars are on the limit. To get the best lap time, you need to get the car rotated confidently and decisively to be able to carry the speed through the corner and guarantee a strong exit.\r\n\r\nYou cannot imagine, said Sainz in an interview with Sky Sports F1 when asked of how different it was to jump from a McLaren to a Ferrari. Ive changed teams; four different cars in the last six years. Its like jumping into a different category for you to understand (as a driver). Everything feels different and I dont understand how, by feeling so different, the cars can get to such a close lap time. I am actually enjoying the experience of having to adapt myself to drive each car in a certain way.\r\n\r\nSainz demonstrated this in the early laps of the recent Emilia Romagna Grand Prix at Imola. Early in the race, he had a couple of off-track moments as he tried to learn the best settings to make the car work in the damp conditions, but thereafter settled in well. Ultimately, he finished fifth and just behind teammate Charles Leclerc.\r\n\r\nArguably, Sainz has been the most accomplished of those who have moved teams. Its no coincidence that hes also had plenty of old-car running to prepare, but he admits that qualifying is the big challenge for him. Hes still mastering how to extract those final hundredths in every corner, how to hit the kerbs, how to carry every last iota of speed.\r\n\r\nThe same is true of all of the newcomers. The difference was less obvious in Bahrain, largely because pre-season testing ran into the first race weekend. But at Imola, a track with little margin for error where a driver requires absolute confidence in what the car can do to produce the precision needed for the best lap time, it was much more difficult. And when the rain came at the start of the race, it created circumstances Perez described as brutal.','2021-04-27',1,2,'https://racer.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/85/2021/04/1018562319-LAT-20210417-GP2102_081153_J5A6118.jpg','https://racer.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/85/2021/04/1018566236-LAT-20210418-GP2102_141114_J5A9399.jpg',0,NULL,'srki'),(38,NULL,19,'5 Healthy & Convenient Foods To Include In Your Postpartum Diet','Postpartum nutrition is unfortunately often glossed-over for new moms. The focus generally turns toward feeding your new babyand understandably so! Still, it\'s super important for new mothers to prioritize nourishing their bodies well, too. Having a few healthy and convenient foods on hand can take some of the effort and guesswork out of doing so.','Why postpartum nutrition matters.\r\nMuch of the conversation around nutrition for expectant mamas is focused on the months of pregnancy leading up to having a newbornbut nutrition doesn\'t become less important for mothers once the baby is born. This is why we dedicate an entire section in our book The Plant-Based Baby & Toddler just to postpartum nutrition.\r\n\r\nContinuing to feed yourself well after having a baby is critical for physical, mental, and emotional healing. Adequate nourishment also provides energy for the demands of newborn life (hello, lack of sleep all around). Plus, some nutrition needs actually increase for mamas during lactation, as they transfer nutrients to baby via breast milk. \r\n\r\nHaving a variety of nutrient-dense foods that require little prep work can be a lifesaver for new parents. In addition, we recommend certain supplements as part of your postpartum nutrition routine. A daily multivitamin (or continuing your prenatal) may meet nutrient needs for an omnivorous diet. Plant-based mamas benefit from taking extra vitamin B12 and the omega-3 fatty acids EPA and DHA in supplemental form. \r\n\r\n5 nutrient-rich postpartum foods.\r\nTaste preferences and desire to eat can continue to wax and wane after giving birth, and many breastfeeding mamas experience a ravenous appetite. Whatever your postpartum experience looks like, here are some healthy foods to keep accessible, plus ideas for using them:\r\n\r\n1. Pistachios\r\nPistachios are one of the highest protein snack nuts. They offer 6 grams of complete protein per serving to help fuel your body with essential amino acids. Plus, they\'re a great source of fiber and unsaturated fat to help keep you fuller longer. \r\n\r\nFor middle-of-the-night breastfeeding hunger, try no-shell pistachios as a convenient, healthy snack. You might also enjoy crushed pistachios for extra crunch in a salad, on top of ice cream or yogurt, or blended into homemade pesto.\r\n\r\n2. Tofu\r\nTofu is a great source of protein, as well as the essential nutrients choline and lysine, which can be harder to find on a plant-based diet.\r\n\r\nCholine is important for healthy cells and infant brain development, but the body only makes a small amount. Regardless of diet, most pregnant women don\'t consume enough choline, and this likely continues after giving birth. Choline is transferred via breast milk, and tofu is a good way to make sure you\'re replenishing stores.\r\n\r\nLysine is an essential amino acid we have to get through diet. While plant foods contain all nine essential amino acids, lysine is limited in some of thembut not tofu. \r\n\r\nTofu takes on the flavor of just about anything. It\'s also inexpensive and super versatile. Extra-firm tofu is great to cube and roast, scramble, grill for sandwiches, or use in soup. Silken tofu works well for blending into smoothies or creamy sauces. \r\n\r\n3. Oats\r\nThe jury is still out on whether oats help promote milk supply, but they work anecdotally for some moms. Regardless, there\'s no harm in eating oats, plus they\'re full of soluble fiber, iron, zinc, and B vitamins and can be a great grain alternative for gluten-free mamas.\r\n\r\nUse them to make overnight oats, add a couple of tablespoons to smoothies, grind them into oat flour for baking, or blend them into chickpea snack balls. \r\n\r\n4. Avocado\r\nAvocados are energy-dense and can help keep you fuller for longer. They\'re also packed with fiber, healthy omega-3 fats, and fat-soluble antioxidants that research says can improve breast milk quality. \r\n\r\nPlus, they\'re delicious on just about everything. Smash them on toast with pumpkin seeds and tomatoes, mash them into guacamole, or add them to burritos, bowls, salads, and pasta. You can even add them to green smoothies. \r\n\r\n5. Sweet potatoes\r\nSweet potatoes are a naturally sweet complex carbohydrate that will help keep you satisfied and provide energy for breastfeeding. They\'re also a great source of the antioxidants beta-carotene and vitamin C.\r\n\r\nBake and stuff sweet potatoes with yummy fillings, cube and roast them with olive oil, or make gluten-free sweet potato oat waffles. \r\n\r\nThe takeaway.\r\nEvery mama has a unique postpartum experience, but nutrition is important for everyone. As you learn to feed your new baby, we encourage you to prioritize feeding yourself well, too. This isn\'t always easy with the demands of new motherhood, but incorporating the nutrient-dense plant foods above can help provide the energy and nourishment you need.','2021-04-27',1,4,'https://mindbodygreen-res.cloudinary.com/images/c_fill,g_auto,w_1120,h_747,q_auto,f_auto,fl_lossy/org/sweet_potato_toast_with_avocado_cucumber_smoked_salmon_and_poached_egg4/sweet-potato-toast.jpg','https://mindbodygreen-res.cloudinary.com/images/c_crop,x_0,y_0,w_1733,h_1155/c_fill,g_auto,w_1120,h_747,q_auto,f_auto,fl_lossy/org/c76n6j1njjtrjj7do/soup-with-beans-and-greens.jpg',1,NULL,'zika');
